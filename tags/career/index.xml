      <title>On Hiring: Developers Are Like Stocks</title>

      <description>This post is for those of you who hire developers, and also junior developers who want to be hired. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about how developers are just like individual stocks in the stock market. Time for a little role-playing: you&amp;#8217;re now a stock market investor.
As a financial advisor, your company has given you $2,000,000 USD to invest in the stock market. It&amp;#8217;s made very clear that the future of the company depends on the return on investment (herein called ROI) &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;gains&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; that your investments bring to the company.</description>

      <title>Dev Team Interactions: Accountability &amp; Blame</title>

      <description>As a developer working for a company, you probably work on a team. The interactions on these teams are sometimes pleasant, and other times hostile. What&amp;#8217;s interesting to me is that a lot of the time, a hostile interaction could have been a pleasant one if only approached differently. Hostile teams are created by the actions of the people on them, not by the situations they encounter. One such hostile action is blame.</description>

      <title>Developer Turned Manager</title>

      <description>In February of 2015, I was promoted to Engineering Manager at Stack Overflow. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
There are tons of things I&amp;#8217;ve learned so far, some of which I&amp;#8217;ve learned the hard way. There&amp;#8217;s also a world of difference between managing code, and managing people who code. Your day to day work routine changes completely. You define success differently.</description>

      <description>A Job Listing Let&amp;#8217;s say you were walking down a street one day and noticed an ad for help wanted. It is posted in the window of a bakery. It reads:

      <title>On Credentialism In Software Development</title>

      <description>Intro We&amp;#8217;re just two days from a brand new year and yet the primary measurement of a developer&amp;#8217;s skill seems to be the same as it was 20 years ago. The most important classification to most companies is job title, as I talked about in great detail in my last post. The job title is acquired via working for a veritable slough of credentialist companies whose HR departments break it down very simply:</description>

      <title>The Trouble With Job Titles</title>
      <link>http://www.haneycodes.net/the-trouble-with-job-titles/</link>

      <description>Intro I&amp;#8217;ve had a good career so far. I began working full-time as a programmer in 2008. At that time my title was Junior Developer. I had a decent boss and cool co-workers, and I cut my teeth on Java and .NET. It was a good experience. After 2 years at that gig, I felt that it was time to move on.
I contacted recruiters, and one eventually found me a promotion: Systems Analyst.</description>

      <title>How I Got A Job At Stack Exchange</title>
      <link>http://www.haneycodes.net/how-i-got-a-job-at-stack-exchange/</link>

      <description>Intro Almost exactly 1 month ago today I found myself on a video call with Joel Spolsky. It feels insane to write that, even now, as it was a banner moment in my career. For me it was the equivalent of meeting a movie star who I had idolized since I was old enough to know what movies were. There had always been this Joel Spolsky guy throughout my career that I regularly read about and whose opinions on software development agreed with mine, and suddenly I was talking with him face to face.</description>

      <title>The Joel Test Really is Meaningful</title>

      <description>Well, it&amp;#8217;s been nearly 2 months since my last post&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m learning that if you want a blog to be successful, you have to carve time out of your busy life and make it happen. So, with renewed focus, I re-enter the fray.
The Joel Test is a curious and honest thing. It has been around since the year 2000 and was invented by a guy named Joel Spolsky, as the name might imply.</description>
