      <description>Background I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss an important topic that affects everybody in tech: diversity.
No, this won&amp;#8217;t be some preachy post about how diversity is great and how you should be a better human being. Rather, I&amp;#8217;m going to tell you about the things I&amp;#8217;ve experienced working on diversity &amp;#8211; particularly the interesting events of the last few days that happened internally at Stack Overflow.
It&amp;#8217;s no secret that the tech industry is not that diverse.</description>
