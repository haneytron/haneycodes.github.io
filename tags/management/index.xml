      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while Well I failed badly in my mission to blog every week of 2017. I guess life and stuff just got in the way in the end. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be more consistent in the second half of 2018.
Anyway, I bring some news: I have a new blog engine, and we are hiring at Stack Overflow!
New blog engine I was previously using WordPress but had many issues and concerns with it.</description>

      <description>This post is for those of you who hire developers, and also junior developers who want to be hired. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about how developers are just like individual stocks in the stock market. Time for a little role-playing: you&amp;#8217;re now a stock market investor.
As a financial advisor, your company has given you $2,000,000 USD to invest in the stock market. It&amp;#8217;s made very clear that the future of the company depends on the return on investment (herein called ROI) &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;gains&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; that your investments bring to the company.</description>

      <title>Developer Turned Manager</title>

      <description>In February of 2015, I was promoted to Engineering Manager at Stack Overflow. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
There are tons of things I&amp;#8217;ve learned so far, some of which I&amp;#8217;ve learned the hard way. There&amp;#8217;s also a world of difference between managing code, and managing people who code. Your day to day work routine changes completely. You define success differently.</description>
