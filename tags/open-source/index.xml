      <description>This post is for those of you who hire developers, and also junior developers who want to be hired. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about how developers are just like individual stocks in the stock market. Time for a little role-playing: you&amp;#8217;re now a stock market investor.
As a financial advisor, your company has given you $2,000,000 USD to invest in the stock market. It&amp;#8217;s made very clear that the future of the company depends on the return on investment (herein called ROI) &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;gains&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; that your investments bring to the company.</description>

      <description>Jonathan Allen of InfoQ conducted an interview with me about one of my open source initiatives, SimplSockets. We discussed the value of TCP over HTTP and why Sockets are still relevant to programming.
I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Jonathan and InfoQ for the opportunity &amp;#8211; it was a great discussion. Check it out here: http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/12/SimplSockets</description>
