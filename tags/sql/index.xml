      <description>The T4 template engine is insanely powerful. I didn&amp;#8217;t really realize just how powerful it was until I had a use case for it today. I stood up a database with about 40 tables in it, and planned to use an ORM to access the database. To use the ORM, I needed POCOs (Plain Old C# Objects) that represented my database. Some of these tables had 30-50 or so columns and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to code all of this by hand &amp;#8211; it would take literally days.</description>
