      <description>Most of us have been there: you&amp;#8217;ve written a fantastic application that performs perfectly in your Development and/or QA environments, but in Production something goes wrong. Your application spins out of control, utilizing 100% of your CPU. Maybe it simply stops responding as if it were deadlocked. Or maybe it simply crashes randomly. What now?
Logic tells you that you have a problem in the code somewhere that is only encountered in a Production-like environment&amp;#8230; and if you could JUST get into the Production box, install Visual Studio (or at least the Remote Debugger), and debug the application, you&amp;#8217;d be able to solve the problem.</description>
