      <description>A few weeks back I wrote this tweet:
I did a presentation / speaking thing last week that got me thinking: would it be useful to blog about how to build a resume as someone new to tech, from the perspective of a hiring manager? I might whip that up today or tomorrow if people like the idea.

      <title>On Hiring: Developers Are Like Stocks</title>

      <description>This post is for those of you who hire developers, and also junior developers who want to be hired. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about how developers are just like individual stocks in the stock market. Time for a little role-playing: you&amp;#8217;re now a stock market investor.
As a financial advisor, your company has given you $2,000,000 USD to invest in the stock market. It&amp;#8217;s made very clear that the future of the company depends on the return on investment (herein called ROI) &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;gains&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; that your investments bring to the company.</description>

      <title>Dev Team Interactions: Conducting Good Code Reviews</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/dev-team-interactions-conducting-good-code-reviews/</link>

      <description>In part 2 of my series on dev team interactions, I&amp;#8217;d like to talk about conducting good code reviews. Most dev teams will find themselves in a situation where code reviews are necessary, and in my experience many do them very poorly. I&amp;#8217;ve even worked in companies that had such a negative code review culture that people left the review sessions upset, even considering quitting. With a few easy adjustments, you can quickly learn to conduct excellent and positive code reviews with your team.</description>

      <title>Dev Team Interactions: Accountability &amp; Blame</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/dev-team-interactions-accountability-blame/</link>

      <description>As a developer working for a company, you probably work on a team. The interactions on these teams are sometimes pleasant, and other times hostile. What&amp;#8217;s interesting to me is that a lot of the time, a hostile interaction could have been a pleasant one if only approached differently. Hostile teams are created by the actions of the people on them, not by the situations they encounter. One such hostile action is blame.</description>

      <title>Our Industry Needs Compassion</title>

      <description>Well, I&amp;#8217;ve utterly failed to blog at regular intervals, writing only three posts in 2016. Ouch. To be fair, one of those posts is insanely famous (the one about NPM and left-pad.js), but still, I&amp;#8217;ve really let my readers &amp;#8211; and myself &amp;#8211; down.
So, I resolve to write a blog post every single week of 2017, starting today. This will probably mean that I write slightly shorter posts, and maybe even multi-part series posts.</description>

      <description>On Plumbers Picture this situation: you woke up this morning to find that there&amp;#8217;s no water coming through your valves and taps. No sink water. No shower water. Having no plumbing experience, you call around for a plumber.
Plumber #1 Plumber #1, let&amp;#8217;s call him Mario, tells you he can&amp;#8217;t be bothered to come check out your issue because it&amp;#8217;s minor and he&amp;#8217;s very important and too busy for it.</description>

      <title>Diversity Is Really Freaking Hard</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/diversity-is-really-freaking-hard/</link>

      <description>Background I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss an important topic that affects everybody in tech: diversity.
No, this won&amp;#8217;t be some preachy post about how diversity is great and how you should be a better human being. Rather, I&amp;#8217;m going to tell you about the things I&amp;#8217;ve experienced working on diversity &amp;#8211; particularly the interesting events of the last few days that happened internally at Stack Overflow.
It&amp;#8217;s no secret that the tech industry is not that diverse.</description>

      <description>A Job Listing Let&amp;#8217;s say you were walking down a street one day and noticed an ad for help wanted. It is posted in the window of a bakery. It reads:

      <title>On Credentialism In Software Development</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/on-credentialism-in-software-development/</link>

      <description>Intro We&amp;#8217;re just two days from a brand new year and yet the primary measurement of a developer&amp;#8217;s skill seems to be the same as it was 20 years ago. The most important classification to most companies is job title, as I talked about in great detail in my last post. The job title is acquired via working for a veritable slough of credentialist companies whose HR departments break it down very simply:</description>

      <title>The Trouble With Job Titles</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/the-trouble-with-job-titles/</link>

      <guid>https://www.davidhaney.io/the-trouble-with-job-titles/</guid>
      <description>Intro I&amp;#8217;ve had a good career so far. I began working full-time as a programmer in 2008. At that time my title was Junior Developer. I had a decent boss and cool co-workers, and I cut my teeth on Java and .NET. It was a good experience. After 2 years at that gig, I felt that it was time to move on.
I contacted recruiters, and one eventually found me a promotion: Systems Analyst.</description>

      <title>How I Got A Job At Stack Exchange</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/how-i-got-a-job-at-stack-exchange/</link>

      <description>Intro Almost exactly 1 month ago today I found myself on a video call with Joel Spolsky. It feels insane to write that, even now, as it was a banner moment in my career. For me it was the equivalent of meeting a movie star who I had idolized since I was old enough to know what movies were. There had always been this Joel Spolsky guy throughout my career that I regularly read about and whose opinions on software development agreed with mine, and suddenly I was talking with him face to face.</description>

      <title>The Joel Test Really is Meaningful</title>

      <description>Well, it&amp;#8217;s been nearly 2 months since my last post&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m learning that if you want a blog to be successful, you have to carve time out of your busy life and make it happen. So, with renewed focus, I re-enter the fray.
The Joel Test is a curious and honest thing. It has been around since the year 2000 and was invented by a guy named Joel Spolsky, as the name might imply.</description>
